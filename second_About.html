                <h3>Mission </h3>
                <p>Here are my ideas for the website. They’re not fancy. But they should give you an idea of what we are looking for. We can worry about a nicer look for the site later. For now, I’d like to focus on getting some basic content about the league up for our current and prospective members and their parents. (And no, not everyone in our league is on Facebook! We need our own site.)</p>
